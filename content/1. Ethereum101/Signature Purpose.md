# 41 - [Signature Purpose](Signature%20Purpose.md)

A digital signature serves three purposes in Ethereum: 
1. Proves that the owner of the private key, who is by implication the owner of an [Ethereum Account](Ethereum%20Account.md), has authorized the spending of ether, or execution of a contract 
2. Guarantees non-repudiation: the proof of authorization is undeniable
3. Proves that the transaction data has not been and cannot be modified by anyone after the transaction has been signed.
